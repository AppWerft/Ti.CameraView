Ti.CameraView
===========================================

This is a collection of module for displaying camera as view. The android version  [Ti-Android-CameraView
](https://github.com/brownemint/Ti-Android-CameraView) works as aspected.
For iOS I have tested 4 versions, only the SquareCamera seams to work. 

### [ti.cameraview](https://github.com/vijaysingh-axway/ti.cameraview)

Shows `invalid method (createCamera) passed to TiCameraviewModule` although this method is part of example and of source code in module (??)

### [be.k0suke.ticamera](https://github.com.k0sukey/TiCameraView)

On repo is a screenshot, but after starting a sample app the app crashes without comment.

### [com.mfogg.squarecamera](https://github.com/mikefogg/SquareCamera)

This module works, but after adding some views the camera disappears. Workaround: adding the overlay to parent view.

### [ti.camera](https://github.com/jonathanrcarter/CameraView)

Works and it is possible to add subviews.

### [Hyperloop version]()
